# CSVtoHDLsim
Small Python script that converts logic statets from CSV file to HDL simulation code.

It provides quick and easy way to simulate real life signals registered by logic analyser software.

## Usage
`CSVtoHDLsim.py [-h] [-v] [-l {VHDL}] [--dialect] [--time UNIT] file`

If you have CSV generated by Saleae software and you want VHDL output code, you can just pass file name as a parameter.

Output is written directly to stdout.

### Positional arguments

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `file` | CSV file to parse |

### Optional arguments:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `-h`, `--help` | show this help message and exit |
| `-v`, `--version` | show program's version number and exit |
| `-l {VHDL}`, `--lang {VHDL}` | Select output language |
| `--dialect DIALECT`, `-d DIALECT `|  Set dialect of CSV file (passed to `csv.reader`) |
| `--time UNIT`, `-t UNIT` | Set time unit (in language specific notation) |

## CSV file format

It's compatible with CSVs generated with *Saleae* logic analyzer software.

First column should be timestamp of logic state, which is represented as **1** or **0** in next columns for specific signals.
In the first row there should be names of signals.

You can find sample files in `examples` directory.

## HDL languages

There is currently support only for VHDL, but there are plans to implement Verilog and potentially other languages support.
Bear in mind that this script doesn't generate full simulation file, but just simulation code â€“ adequate wait statement and signal assigment.
